# Benchmark
Benchmark is a blockchain application that enables servers and network users to test their connectivity with peers.  The reports are encrypted and stored on the blockchain database and customers can download the report listing they need and pay to decrypt them.

To make the whitepaper easier to read, we will call the entity that request reports "clients", the entity that verify the bandwidth of clients "servers" and the entity that buys reports "customers".

## Business
The business of the benchmark application is to sell benchmark reports based on the customer's specifications.  The target customers are companies and/or organizations that are affected by mobile activity and network usage.

### Network Providers
Mobile and broadband network operators can detect geographical locations where they have slow connectivity and execute alerts to warn their customer support automatically or execute any other actions in their corporate infrastructure.

They can also create reports to detect the connectivity speed of their competitors on a specific geolocation, detect their weak spots and target their user acquisition strategy to that specific geolocation, on customers of that competitor.

### Content delivery networks
Content delivery networks (CDN's) have origin servers where they host the original files of their customers.  They then create copies of those files on servers that are physically located near the customers that want to download those files.

By using the benchmark blockchain reports, CDN's could detect the speed at which the file downloaders downloads from their server and automatically serve the files to the downloaders using the fastest route.

### Smart content delivery network
We will create a smart CDN network where file hosts (servers) can be provided by anyone, anywhere.  The speed between decentralized servers and the downloaders will be provided by the benchmark blockchain reports, automatically.  That way, downloaders will always receive their files from the quickest servers possible.

### Benchmark Partners
We don't want to create our own client applications.  There is already enough benchmark client applications available.  Instead of competing with them, we want to partner with them, so they each use our blockchain.  Each partner will have tokens in the benchmark blockchain, making them part owners of the global benchmark blockchain.

Here's a list of the partners we want to target:

### Hardware manufacturers
We want to work with hardware manufacturers in order to ship a built-in client in their networking related hardware.  That way, their clients will be able to have their real networking data and be paid for the data they provide on the benchmark blockchain.

The strategy is to make it possible for hardware manufacturers to lower their hardware price and receive a portion of the client's long-term earnings.

The hardware manufacturers we want to target includes router, modem, cellphones, smart TV's and video game consoles.

Here's a list of the hardware manufacturers companies we want to target:

### Software and video game companies
Software companies, including mobile software, video game software and PC software, sometimes heavily depend on internet connectivity.  We want to help software developers monetize their software by making benchmark reports on our blockchain.  The software would know if the user's internet connection is fast enough to work properly with the software, and the software company would earn benchmark tokens in order to create reports of their users on the benchmark blockchain.

Here's a list of software companies we want to target:

## Token
The benchmark blockchain is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain application, where each node have an equal voting power on the blockchain as the amount of token they pledge.

The tokens are all generated at first, then distributed among the original developers of the project and people that add value to its ecosystem.

## Voting system
Every request on the benchmark blockchain is a request that needs to be voted on by a group of people.  That group vary depends on the type of request.

### Token holder votes
When the request affect the whole benchmark blockchain community, that request needs to be voted by token holders.  Each token represents 1 vote.  So, if a wallet votes to approve a request, and if that wallet holds 100k tokens, that wallet votes with a power of 100k.

The percentage of token holders needed in order to approve or disapprove a request is also voted by the token holders.

A token request can be, for example, the maximum amount of validator nodes the blockchain accepts.

### Wallet shareholders votes
When the request affect a given wallet, the request needs to be voted by the wallet shareholders.  If a user has 5 shares in a wallet, that user votes with a power of 5.

The percentage of shareholders needed in order to approve or disapprove a request is voted by the wallet shareholders.  Therefore, the percentage needed varies from one wallet to another.

A wallet request can be, for a example, a token transfer from a wallet to another.

### Economic
In the benchmark blockchain, the clients are paid to request reports on the blockchain.  Servers owns the reports and are paid when customers orders reports from them.

Every time a customer orders a report, a percentage of the transaction goes to a wallet that is held by all token holders.  The remaining goes to the server that owns the report.

Clients are paid every time a report is generated with them.  The amount they are paid per report and the frequency at which they can request reports are voted by all token holders.

If the community wallet contains too much tokens, the token holders can vote to withdraw some tokens it holds to all token holders.  On the other hand, if it lack funds to pay clients, the token holders can vote to take tokens from everyone in the blockchain, pro-rata of the token each wallet owns.

### Decentralization
The benchmark blockchain tokens is a project created by the Artiqox team.  Therefore, the Artiqox coin (AIQ) holders will receive a good portion of the original benchmark tokens.

Partners that currently run benchmark websites and want to convert their application to use this blockchain will receive the remaining tokens.

The AIQ holders will be able to download the benchmark application, import their AIQ private keys and tell the benchmark blockchain which wallet they own, to create a match between the wallets of the benchmark wallet with their AIQ wallets.  By doing so, the blockchain will know the amount of benchmark tokens to send to which wallet, based on AIQ ownership, at the airdrop date.

There will be no ICO for this project.

### Future development
In the benchmark client application (GUI), there is a built-in project management system.  Every token holder will be able to create new projects, then the token holders will vote in order to accept/refuse the new project.

Each project can have milestones with a specific mission.  A milestone must be funded in benchmark token in order to be executed.  A milestone can be project development, sales tasks, emails to sends, interviews with journalists and/or articles to write to communicate with the community.

Every time someone executes a task and submit it as done, the project manager of that specific project must review it.  When a milestone is finished, the token holders verifies that the milestone is completed.  If the token holders approves the milestone, everyone that executed tasks get paid automatically.

The project manager receives a percentage of all the earnings made by the people that executed tasks on his project.  The percentage is voted by the token holders.A

### Guarantee
Each person that wants to provide a service to the benchmark blockchain needs to be trusted by the token holders.  In order to be trusted, each person must make a pledge to the blockchain wallet.  The pledge amount varies depending of the service provided.  If a person act against the interest of the benchmark blockchain, the pledge is seized and deposited in the blockchain wallet.

#### Validator nodes
The benchmark blockchain is a proof-of-stake blockchain. The stake is a pledge that the node makes to the network's wallet.  If a node propagate false information regarding blocks and the network discovers the rogue activity, the pledge will be seized and given to the network's wallet.

#### Servers
People that wants to execute benchmark reports for clients on the benchmark blockchain will need to create a pledge to the network's wallet.  The amount of the pledge is being voted by the token holders.

If a server gives information that is very different from the other server's information, the network will give strikes on the server for potentially acting maliciously.  After X amount of strikes, the network will seize the server's pledge.  The amount of strikes is being voted by the token holders.

#### Task workers
When a worker takes a task on the benchmark blockchain in order to make its ecosystem evolve (developers, sales, project managers, etc), that person needs to pledge tokens in order to show confidence that he can execute the task properly.

If the task ends up not being executed properly after a given timeframe, the worker's pledge will be seized and given to the project's wallet.

That way, workers don't need to be pre-vetted using interviews.  Anyone can take any task but if a person doesn't execute his task properly, he will lose tokens.  On the other hand, if the task is executed properly, that worker will earn new tokens for providing value to the benchmark blockchain.
