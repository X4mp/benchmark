# Benchmark
Benchmark is a blockchain application that enables servers and mobile users to test their connectivity with peers.  The reports are encrypted and stored on the blockchain database and customers can download the report listing they need and pay to decrypt them.

To make the wallpaper easier to read, we will call the entity that request reports "clients", the entity that verify the bandwidth of clients "servers" and the entity that buys reports "customers".

## Business
The business of the benchmark application is to sell benchmark reports based on the customer's specifications.  The target customers are companies and/or organizations that are affected by mobile activity and network usage.

### Mobile networks
Mobile networks can detect geographic locations where they have slow mobile connectivity and execute alerts to warn their customer support automatically or execute any other actions in their corporate infrastructure.

They can also create reports to detect the connectivity speed of their competitors on a specific geolocation, detect their weak spots and target their user acquisition strategy to that specific geolocation, on customers of that competitor.

### Content delivery networks
Content delivery networks (CDN's) have origin servers where they host the original files of their customers.  They then create copies of those files on servers that are physically located near the customers that want to download those files.

By using the benchmark blockchain reports, CDN's could detect the speed at which the file downloaders downloads from their server and automatically serve the files to the downloaders using the fastest route.

### Smart content delivery network
We will create a smart CDN network where file hosts (servers) can be provided by anyone, anywhere.  The speed between decentralized servers and the downloaders will be provided by the benchmark blockchain reports, automatically.  That way, downloaders will always receive their files from the quickest servers possible.

### Partners
We don't want to create our own client applications.  There is already enough benchmark client applications available.  Instead of competing with them, we want to partner with them, so they each use our blockchain.  Each partner will have tokens in the benchmark blockchain, making them part owners of the global benchmark blockchain.

Here's a list of the partners we want to target:


## Token
The benchmark blockchain is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain application, where each node have an equal voting power on the blockchain as the amount of token they pledge.

The tokens are all generated at first, then distributed among the original developers of the project and people that add value to its ecosystem.

## Voting system
### Token holder votes
### Wallet shareholders votes

### Economic
In the benchmark blockchain, the clients are paid to request reports on the blockchain.  Servers owns the reports and are paid when customers orders reports from them.

Every time a customer orders a report, a percentage of the transaction goes to a wallet that is held by all token holders.  The remaining goes to the server that owns the report.

Clients are paid every time a report is generated with them.  The amount they are paid per report and the frequency at which they can request reports are voted by all token holders.

If the community wallet contains too much tokens, the token holders can vote to withdraw some tokens it holds to all token holders.  On the other hand, if it lack funds to pay clients, the token holders can vote to take tokens from everyone in the blockchain, pro-rata of the token each wallet owns.

### Decentralization
The benchmark blockchain tokens is a project created by the Artiqox team.  Therefore, the Artiqox coin (AIQ) holders will receive a good portion of the original benchmark tokens.

Partners that currently run benchmark websites and want to convert their application to use this blockchain will receive the remaining tokens.

The AIQ holders will be able to download the benchmark application, import their AIQ private keys and tell the benchmark blockchain which wallet they own, to create a match between the wallets of the benchmark wallet with their AIQ wallets.  By doing so, the blockchain will know the amount of benchmark tokens to send to which wallet, based on AIQ ownership, at the airdrop date.

There will be no ICO for this project.

### Future development
In the benchmark client application (GUI), there is a built-in project management system.  Every token holder will be able to create new projects, then the token holders will vote in order to accept/refuse the new project.

Each project can have milestones with a specific mission.  A milestone must be funded in benchmark token in order to be executed.  A milestone can be project development, sales tasks, emails to sends, interviews with journalists and/or articles to write to communicate with the community.

Every time someone executes a task and submit it as done, the project manager of that specific project must review it.  When a milestone is finished, the token holders verifies that the milestone is completed.  If the token holders approves the milestone, everyone that executed tasks get paid automatically.

The project manager receives a percentage of all the earnings made by the people that executed tasks on his project.  The percentage is voted by the token holders.
