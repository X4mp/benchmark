# Benchmark
Benchmark is a blockchain application that enables servers and mobile users to test their connectivity with peers.  The reports are encrypted and stored on the blockchain database and customers can download the report listing they need and pay to decrypt them.

## Business
The business of the benchmark application is to sell benchmark reports based on the customer's specifications.  The target customers are companies and/or organizations that are affected by mobile activity and network usage.

### Mobile networks
Mobile networks can detect geographic locations where they have slow mobile connectivity and execute alerts to warn their customer support automatically or execute any other actions in their corporate infrastructure.

They can also create reports to detect the connectivity speed of their competitors on a specific geolocation, detect their weak spots and target their user acquisition strategy to that specific geolocation, on customers of that competitor.

### Content delivery networks
Content delivery networks (CDN's) have origin servers where they host the original files of their customers.  They then create copies of those files on servers that are physically located near the customers that want to download those files.

By using the benchmark blockchain reports, CDN's could detect the speed at which the file downloaders downloads from their server and automatically serve the files to the downloaders using the fastest route.

### Smart content delivery network
We will create a smart CDN network where file hosts (servers) can be provided by anyone, anywhere.  The speed between decentralized servers and the downloaders will be provided by the benchmark blockchain reports, automatically.  That way, downloaders will always receive their files from the quickest servers possible.
